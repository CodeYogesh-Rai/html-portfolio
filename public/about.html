    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Yogesh Rai, an aspiring electrical engineer with a strong
      foundation in power distribution, auto electrical systems, and electrical
      infrastructure maintenance. Currently, I am completing my Diploma in
      Electrical Engineering under CTEVT, with plans to further my education
      through a bachelor’s degree. I have gained hands-on experience in
      electrical system operation and maintenance through a 6-month internship
      at Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Kuleshwor, where I worked alongside
      professionals to troubleshoot, optimize, and enhance power distribution
      networks. My expertise extends to fault diagnosis, grid inspections, and
      system efficiency improvements, making me well-equipped to contribute to
      Nepal’s growing energy sector. Beyond electrical engineering, I have
      specialized training in auto electric systems, certified by SIPRADI,
      Kathmandu Metropolitan, which has broadened my technical skill set in
      vehicle electrical diagnostics and maintenance. I am passionate about
      innovation, problem-solving, and technological advancements in the
      electrical field. Whether it’s optimizing power distribution systems,
      diagnosing faults, or improving efficiency, I strive to make a meaningful
      impact through my work. If you’re interested in learning more about my
      projects, skills, or potential collaborations, feel free to explore my
      portfolio or get in touch!
